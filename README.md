mbed iOS application for ARM TechCon mbed Hands On Workshop

This is a super-simple, quick and dirty iOS app that uses the Square SocketRocket WebSockets framework to communicate with an mbed LPC1768 + Application Board + Sprint CDMA modem. When the mbed board is running the firmware available at https://mbed.org/users/davidswi/code/iOSAppChat and has the required Application Board and Sprint USB modem, this iOS application can send strings to the mbed to display on its LCD.

Thanks to the mbed team for creating such a cool and easy to use prototyping environment!
